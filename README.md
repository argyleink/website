## ArgyleInk Website
I made a new portfolio in 5 days. The result is in this repo and the prod result at [my portfolio site](http://argyleink.com).

### Forked from my project starter @ [Jade/Stylus/Grunt Project Starter](https://github.com/argyleink/project-grunt.jade.stylus)

### This site has:
- Clean Grunt task architecture: `/tasks`
- Bower clientside module management
- Dev and Prod builds: `grunt prod`
- AutoReload and server built in `0.0.0.0:3030`
- Jade for static HTML generation
- Jade for client side templating
- Stylus with Nib
- Flexbox grid layout

Setup
=======
Clone and cd into this repo directory from terminal  
Run `npm install`, this will install all the npm and bower dependencies
When it's done, run `grunt`  

#### Note
After you've run setup, subsequent app runs should be done with `grunt`
