p I have an affinity for gestures, and I think it's rooted in the Nintendo Power Glove. There is just something too cool about having magic power come from your hands. My thesis to get my BS was about gestures, and their plausability of entering society as a normal interface. I want my hands to be powerful!
p Kinect made your body powerful, and it's still fun and cool to use today. But the leap was so much smaller, so much more nimbal as a product, and had really nice controls. With the Leap, I did feel like my hands were powerful. The first game I tried to make, was Duck Hunt. I wanted to be able to shoot, using a single hand gesture (maybe 2), to aim and shoot ducks.
p The source code for what I got done is available in a link at the top of this article. I got it to work most of the time, but not perfect. The new changes to the Leap just recently (June 2014), look very promising. I'll have to take the project up again!
